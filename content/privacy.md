## Privacy Policy

Your privacy is important to me. This Privacy Policy outlines how information is handled on **hemendra.in**, a static website built using **Hugo** and the **PaperMod** theme.

By using this website, you agree to the terms described in this policy.

## Nature of This Website

This is a **static personal website** created for sharing technical content, blogs, and project information.

- The site does **not** use contact forms, comment forms, or user registration.
- No personal information is directly collected or stored by this website.
- Any communication happens outside the site through external platforms.

## Information We Collect

This website does not collect personally identifiable information.

However, limited **non-personal, anonymized usage data** may be collected automatically through analytics services, including:

- Pages visited and navigation patterns  
- Device and browser type  
- Approximate geographic region  
- Session duration  

This data is used strictly for understanding site usage and improving content quality.

## Google Analytics

This website uses **Google Analytics** to analyze traffic and improve user experience. The analytics setup is configured with privacy-friendly options provided by Hugo:

- **Respect “Do Not Track” (DNT):**  
  Analytics tracking is disabled for users who have enabled Do Not Track in their browser.
- **Session-based storage:**  
  Session storage is used instead of persistent cookies where possible.
- **No intentional personal identification:**  
  The site owner does not attempt to identify individual users.

Google may process anonymized usage data on its servers according to its own privacy policies.

## Third-Party Services

This website relies on third-party services such as Google Analytics. These services operate under their own privacy policies, and this Privacy Policy does not extend to them.

I encourage you to review their policies for more detailed information.

## Data Security

As a static website, **hemendra.in** does not maintain databases or user accounts. Reasonable measures are taken to ensure the site is delivered securely, but no internet transmission is completely secure.
